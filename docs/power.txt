Power simulation!

This is supposed to be somewhat accurate, but also leave out a bunch of details that would require complicated
simulation and lots of work to use.

The basic idea is that there are a bunch of nodes:

       C   C   C   C
       |   |   |   |
    C --------------- C
       |   |   |   |
       C   C   C   C
           |
           |--C
           |
     P--P--P--P--P--P--P

    C stands for a power-consuming entity and P stands for a power-producing entity.

In this example, all of these entities are part of the same power network.

Power is measured entirely in Watts. Rather than attempt to simulate voltage and amperage on the line, the simulation
simply tracks Watt consumption and production.

The network does not simulate power loss - rather, it simply tracks the current consumption and production levels, and
if there is insufficient power, shuts off or scales down various power consumers. Different power consumers may respond
differently to low power conditions.

Watts are measured in whole numbers.
