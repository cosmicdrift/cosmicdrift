# Cosmic Drift

To get started, clone [virtlua](https://github.com/cosmicdrift/virtlua) into your repository as the 'virtlua' folder.
Download [gson-2.4.jar from Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.google.code.gson|gson|2.4|jar), and put it in the root directory of the project.
Copy the `resources` folder into the root directory of the project. (Note: due to licensing issues, we can't put it in the main repo yet.)

Then, you can open Intellij IDEA on this folder, and RUN the project.

This is very much WIP, so don't expect much.
