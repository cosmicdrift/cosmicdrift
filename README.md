# Cosmic Drift

To get started, clone [virtlua](https://github.com/cosmicdrift/virtlua) into your repository as the 'virtlua' folder.

Then, you can open Intellij IDEA on this folder, and run the project.

This is very much WIP, so don't expect much.

# Notes

gson-2.4.jar was downloaded from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.google.code.gson|gson|2.4|jar).

If you want, copy the sound resources into the `resources` directory of the project. (Note: due to licensing issues, we can't put them in the main repo yet.)
