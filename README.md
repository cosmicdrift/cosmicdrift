# Cosmic Drift

To get started, clone [virtlua](https://github.com/cosmicdrift/virtlua) into your repository as the 'virtlua' folder.
Download [gson-2.4.jar from Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.google.code.gson|gson|2.4|jar), and put it in the root directory of the project.

Then, you can open Intellij IDEA on this folder, and RUN the project.

This is very much WIP, so don't expect much.
